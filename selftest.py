"""Headless diagnostic self-test — `Macronaut.exe --selftest`.

Image matching and OCR are the two features that fail *silently* in a frozen
build. `matcher.py` catches ImportError and degrades; `ocr.py` falls back to a
null engine. Nothing crashes, no dialog appears — the features simply stop
working, and only in the packaged .exe. That is how a build shipped with numpy
excluded while cv2 was bundled, and nobody could have noticed by launching it.

So this does not ask "does the module import?" — a bundled-but-broken dependency
answers yes. It runs each feature end to end against generated input with a
known-correct answer:

  * image match — screenshot the desktop, crop a patch out of it, then search
    for that patch and assert it is found at the coordinates it was cut from.
  * OCR        — render known text to an image, read it back, compare.

Exit code 0 = everything a release needs is working, 1 = something is broken.
Run it against `dist/Macronaut.exe`, not `python main.py`: passing from source
proves nothing about the bundle. See TESTING.md section B.
