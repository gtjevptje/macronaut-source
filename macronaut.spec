# ── OCR engines are chosen at RUNTIME, by dynamic import ──────────────────────
# ocr.py selects its engine with importlib.import_module(root + ".windows.media.ocr"),
# so PyInstaller's static analysis never sees these names and leaves them out.
# The result is the nastiest kind of broken build: Windows OCR is missing, ocr.py
# silently falls through to its fallback, `ocr.available()` still returns True,
# Settings still reports OCR as available -- and every Wait-for-Text step reads
# nothing at all. Caught by `Macronaut.exe --selftest`, never by launching it.
#
# Only the namespaces ocr.py actually imports.
#
# These are the SPLIT `winrt-*` packages, not the monolithic `winsdk` this used
# to bundle. winsdk projects the entire WinRT surface through one 38.5 MB .pyd
# to give us five namespaces; the split packages weigh 3.1 MB for the same five
# — 10 MB off every download, with identical OCR output (verified by reading
# rendered text back through both). `winsdk` is excluded below so a machine that
# still has it installed cannot quietly put it back in the bundle.
#
# ⚠ `windows.foundation` is what makes recognize_async awaitable, and the OCR
# package does NOT declare it as a dependency. Without it the engine imports,
# constructs, reports itself available — and reads nothing, forever, silently.

# -> huggingface_hub -> pyarrow / boto3 / av / sklearn. That cascade was 300+ MB
# of an ~350 MB build, for code that never runs.

# ── The RapidOCR fallback, removed in 2.0.12 ──────────────────────────────────
# ocr.py had a second engine behind Windows OCR. It never worked in a frozen
# build: rapidocr reads its .onnx models and config.yaml from its own package
# directory, nothing here ever collected them, and there is not one model file
# in any published .exe. So the engine reported itself unavailable and every
# download carried 13.2 MB to run nothing:
#
#     onnxruntime  11.63 MB · shapely 1.46 MB · pyclipper 0.10 MB  (compressed)
#
# It is gone from ocr.py and requirements.txt too, so these are belt and braces
# for the day something transitively imports one of them again. `onnxruntime`
# here is the ROOT; the `.transformers` entry above stays because it documents a
# different and much larger trap (it drags in torch).

# are DATA entries, so a binaries-only filter silently keeps 1.9 MB of them.
#
# NOT trimmed on purpose:
#   opengl32sw.dll (7.7 MB) — Qt's software OpenGL fallback. Dropping it saves
#     the single biggest Qt file, but breaks rendering on machines with broken or
#     missing GPU drivers. The MB beats a black window on someone's PC.
#   Qt6OpenGL.dll (0.4 MB) — small, and QtGui can reach for it at runtime.
#   imageformats\qwebp, qtiff, qgif, qico, qjpeg — a user browses to their own
#     template image, and a format we cannot decode shows an empty node
#     thumbnail. Cheap insurance; leave them.
#   libcrypto-3.dll / libssl-3.dll — Python's own OpenSSL. HTTPS in updater.py
#     and crashsend.py runs on these. Only the `-x64` DUPLICATES go (see below).
