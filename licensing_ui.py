"""The two licence dialogs. Kept out of main.py, like `updater_ui` and `crash_ui`.

Someone meets these at exactly two moments: they pressed Play on a flow the free
tier will not run, or they have bought a key and want to enter it. Both are
short, and both are written on the assumption that the person in front of them
is *trying to give us money* and should not have to work at it.

Three things the upgrade dialog deliberately does not do:

- **It does not appear on a timer, on launch, or on a schedule.** It appears
  when a specific flow cannot run, says which of its steps are the reason, and
  otherwise never exists. A nag screen is the thing that makes people uninstall
  free software, and the free tier is the marketing.
- **It does not hide the price behind a click.** The number is on the button.
- **It does not lose the user's work.** The flow they built is still there,
  still editable, still saveable. Cancelling this dialog returns them to it.
