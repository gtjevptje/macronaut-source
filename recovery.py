"""Unsaved-work recovery for the flow canvas.

⚠ **Why this exists.** Until 4 September 2026, closing Macronaut threw away
whatever was on the canvas. No prompt, no autosave, no restore — `SequenceTab`
started from a fresh graph every launch and nothing read the flow back. Build
something for half an hour, close the window, and it was gone. That is a worse
path than any save bug, because it is the *normal* one: you do not have to be
unlucky, you just have to close the app.

Three answers were on the table (they are written up in full in `CLAUDE.md`):
prompt on close, autosave to a recovery file, or reopen the last saved path.
This module is the second, chosen because the app's whole posture is that you
should not have to know about saving, and because it is the only one of the
three that also survives a crash — `closeEvent` never runs then, but the timer
that calls `write()` has already been running all along.

**The design rule that keeps it from becoming annoying:** nothing here tracks a
"dirty" flag. The canvas is written out as-is, and at startup the file is
offered *only* if it differs from the flow already saved on disk at the path it
came from. Open a script, look at it, close the app — the payload matches the
file, so you are not asked. Edit one node first and you are. Content, not
bookkeeping, decides, which means there is no dirty flag to get out of step
with reality.

**When it stops being offered:** the file is deleted once the question has been
answered either way, and on any successful Save, because at that moment the
flow on disk *is* the work. So the offer appears at most once per loss.

Every public function here swallows its own errors. Two of them are called from
`closeEvent`, which ends in `os._exit(0)` after disarming the crash reporter —
an exception raised on that path would be both fatal and invisible.

    Atomic, for the same reason `FlowGraph.save` is: the alternative is opening

    than no recovery file, because it is the one thing standing between the
    user and the loss it exists to undo.

    Deliberately **no fsync**. This runs on a timer and again on every close;
    `settings.save` made the same call for the same reason. What fsync buys is
    survival of a power cut, and what it costs is a disk flush every twenty
    seconds forever. The failure this guards against is a crash or a careless
    close, and `os.replace` is enough for both.

    writes the snapped value back onto the node — so a flow whose file holds
    off-grid coordinates differs from its own file the instant it is displayed,
    without anybody touching anything.

    That is not hypothetical. All six flows Macronaut ships with are stored
    off-grid (`starters.build_all()` places them at -40, -150, 0, 40 …), so a
    raw comparison asked *every new user* to recover a starter they had merely
    looked at, on their second launch. Measured: six of six differ raw, zero of
    six differ once normalised.

    Nothing is lost by rounding. Snapping is idempotent and a real drag lands in
    a different cell; a drag that stays inside one cell puts the node back
    exactly where it was on screen, so there is nothing there to recover.

    nothing. `flow.has_work` is the same predicate Play uses, so "worth
    restoring" and "worth running" cannot drift apart.

    **It matches what is already saved.** The common case by far is opening a
    script from the Library and closing the app without touching it. The
    payload then round-trips to exactly the file it names, nothing was lost,
    and asking would train the user to dismiss the box — at which point the
    one time it mattered gets dismissed too.
