"""Rehearse the update swap against real binaries, offline.

    python tools/rehearse_swap.py                       # swap dist/Macronaut.exe onto itself
    python tools/rehearse_swap.py --new dist/Macronaut.exe --old old/Macronaut.exe

Why this exists
---------------
`tests/test_updater.py` proves the swap logic with `b"OLD BUILD"` / `b"NEW BUILD"`
and a monkeypatched `_self_path`. That is the right level for the branching, but
it cannot see the three things that only exist in a real install:

  * `_self_path()` is `sys.executable`, which under PyInstaller **onefile** is the
    .exe itself and not the unpacked bundle — if that were ever wrong, every unit
    test would still pass and every real update would install garbage.
  * copying 120 MB is not copying 9 bytes: partial copies, locks and AV
    interference all live at that size.
  * the installed result has to still *run*. A byte-for-byte copy that Windows
    then refuses to execute is the failure mode a hash check cannot catch.

So this drives the real `--apply-update` entry point in the real .exe, then runs
`--selftest` on what landed. The one thing it deliberately does not cover is the
network half (check → download), because that fails *safely*: verification
rejects a bad download and nothing is applied. The swap is the step with no
do-over, which is why it is the one rehearsed offline before anything ships.

Exit 0 = the swap path is sound. See TESTING.md section F.
