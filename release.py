"""Cut a Macronaut release: bump the version, build the .exe, write the manifest.

The whole point is that the version in `version.py`, the version baked into the
built .exe, and the version the updater advertises are produced by one command
and cannot disagree.

    python release.py --bump patch --notes "Fixed the thing"
    python release.py --publish            # after checking dist/ looks right

Typical flow:

    1. Write RELEASE-NOTES-<new version>.md, then
       python release.py --bump patch
         (the notes file is found by name — --notes / --notes-file override it)
         → bumps version.py, builds dist/Macronaut.exe, writes dist/update.json
         (add --sign once a code-signing certificate exists; it must run before
         the manifest, because signing changes the bytes the hash describes)
    2. Test dist/Macronaut.exe by hand, and rehearse the swap:
         python tools/rehearse_swap.py --new dist/Macronaut.exe --old <previous>
    3. python release.py --publish
         → git tag + `gh release create`, uploading the .exe and the manifest to
           the PUBLIC releases repo (version.UPDATE_REPO).

`--publish` needs the GitHub CLI (`gh auth login` once). If you'd rather upload
by hand, run steps 1-2 and drag both files onto the GitHub release page — the
manifest must be attached as `update.json` or the updater won't find it.

    ⚠ **`UPDATE_REPO` is `gtjevptje/macronaut-releases`, a name this repository

    is baked into every manifest and every shipped build — permanent, by the
    rule in CLAUDE.md. The redirect dies the instant any repository takes that
    name, at which point every install on earth silently stops updating and
    nothing here would report it: `gh release create` would still have
    succeeded, and the manifest would still look perfect.

    This is the one moment the problem is cheap: the release exists, so the URL
    should now resolve, and if it does not the person who just published is
    still standing here. It also catches an upload that reported success but
    attached nothing, and a typo in UPDATE_REPO on a first release.

    ⚠ A HEAD request, and redirects followed on purpose — the redirect is the
    thing under test. Failure prints rather than raises: the release is already
    public by this point, so aborting would leave a published release and an
    angry traceback, which helps nobody. The job here is to say so loudly.

    ⚠ The status code is the whole test, and an earlier draft of this got that
    wrong. It also checked whether the final URL still said `macronaut-releases`,
    on the theory that a name-taken redirect would stop happening — but GitHub
    hands a release asset off to a signed `release-assets.githubusercontent.com`
    blob URL that names no repository at all, so that check could never fire.
    If a repository did take the name, this path would simply 404, which the
    status check already catches. The final URL is not printed for the same
    reason: it is a single-use signed link with a JWT in it, and dumping it into
