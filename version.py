"""Single source of truth for Macronaut's application version.

Everything that needs to know "which build is this?" reads from here: the
About/Settings UI, the updater's comparison, the Windows file-properties
resource baked in by `macronaut.spec`, and `release.py` when it publishes.

Bump `__version__` for a release — `release.py --bump` does it for you, so the
version, the built .exe and the published manifest can never disagree.

Versioning is semver-ish: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, optionally with a pre-release
suffix ("2.1.0-beta.1"). A pre-release sorts BELOW the same numeric version
without one, so 2.1.0-beta.1 < 2.1.0 — a beta tester is offered the final
release as an upgrade, which is what you want.
