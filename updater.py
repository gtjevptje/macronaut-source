"""Self-update: check GitHub Releases, download, verify, swap the .exe.

The shape of it
---------------
1. `check()`   — fetch a small JSON manifest published alongside each release
                 and decide whether it describes something newer than us.
2. `download()`— stream the new .exe into ~/.macronaut/updates/ and verify it
                 against the size + SHA-256 from the manifest.
3. `apply()`   — hand off to the freshly downloaded .exe, which waits for this
                 process to exit, replaces the old file and relaunches it.

Why a manifest instead of the GitHub API: `releases/latest/download/<asset>` is
a permanent redirect to the newest release's asset, so we need no version number
to find it and no API token. It also means moving off GitHub later is a URL
change, not a code change.

api.github.com is the *fallback*, not the route. github.com's web host was
measured refusing this client 12/12 on that download path in August 2026 while
the API and the asset CDN answered 12/12, so both `fetch_manifest()` and
`download()` retry a dead connection and then try the API's asset URL, which
lands on a different host. Staying off the API by default keeps us clear of its
60-requests-an-hour unauthenticated limit; reaching for it when the front door
is shut costs one extra request in the case that would otherwise be a failure.

Security notes — an updater is a remote-code-execution channel into the user's
machine, so the rules here are not optional:

- HTTPS only. A plain-http manifest or asset URL is rejected outright.
- The download is verified against the manifest's SHA-256 **and** size before
  anything is executed; a mismatch deletes the file and aborts.
- The trust anchor is TLS plus the GitHub account. Hash verification protects
  against corruption and a tampered CDN path, but NOT against someone who can
  publish a release — they would control the manifest and the binary alike.
  The real fix is code signing. `signature_status()` performs a live
  Authenticode check today; `REQUIRE_SIGNATURE` decides whether a failure is
  fatal, and stays False only while Macronaut itself ships unsigned.
- Nothing is ever downloaded or applied without the user's `auto_check_updates`
  setting, and applying always requires an explicit confirmation in the UI.

Windows specifics: a running .exe cannot be deleted, but it CAN be renamed. So
the swap is: rename the old one aside, move the new one into its place, relaunch,
and clean up the leftover on the next start. If the move fails half-way the
rename is rolled back, because the one unacceptable outcome is leaving the user
with no working Macronaut.
