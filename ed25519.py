"""Ed25519 signature verification, in pure Python, with no dependencies.

This exists to answer exactly one question at runtime: *did the holder of
Macronaut's private key sign this licence?* Nothing else. There is no signing
here — `tools/mint_license.py` carries that, and it never ships.

## Why hand-rolled rather than `cryptography`

Three reasons, in order of weight:

1. **Build size.** `cryptography` is ~8 MB of wheel plus a PyInstaller hook and a
   bundled OpenSSL. ROADMAP §C records a 352 MB → 105.7 MB fight to get the
   download to a size that suits an app which updates weekly; adding a megabyte
   per licence check would be spending the winnings on nothing.
2. **No new failure mode in the frozen build.** Every dependency added so far
   has broken *once* inside PyInstaller and worked fine from source — OCR read
   nothing in the .exe, numpy was excluded while cv2 was bundled. Code with no
   imports beyond `hashlib` cannot fail that way.
3. **Verification has no secrets in it.** The usual argument against writing
   your own crypto is side channels leaking a key. There is no key here to
   leak: the public key is baked into the .exe and printed on the website. A
   timing attack against a public value recovers a public value.

What is genuinely risky about hand-rolled crypto is getting the *maths* subtly
wrong, so that some signatures verify and others don't — or worse, that forged
ones pass. That is settled by `tests/test_ed25519.py`, which runs the official
RFC 8032 §7.1 test vectors plus the corruption cases. If those pass, this is
Ed25519; if they ever stop passing, this file is wrong and the licence gate is
worthless. Do not weaken that test.

## What is implemented

RFC 8032 Ed25519 (PureEdDSA over edwards25519, SHA-512). Verification only,
using the standard extended-coordinate formulas (Hisil–Wong–Carter–Dawson) so a
check costs milliseconds rather than the seconds a naïve affine implementation
takes. It runs once per app launch, so even that would have been survivable —
but `tools/mint_license.py` reuses these primitives to *generate* keys, and
keygen does the same scalar multiplication.

Deliberately strict where RFC 8032 allows a choice: non-canonical point
encodings (y ≥ p) and out-of-range scalars (S ≥ L) are rejected rather than
reduced. A licence key is not a network protocol that has to interoperate with
someone else's encoder — the only thing on earth that produces these is
`mint_license.py` — so there is no compatibility to buy by being lenient, and
malleability is exactly what a forger would go looking for.
