"""The flows a brand-new user finds in their library.

Downloading this and opening it gives you one green Start node on an empty
canvas and an empty Script Library. Someone who searched for "auto clicker"
now has to learn a node graph before they can click anything — which is a
long way to travel for the thing they thought they were downloading, and
most of them do not travel it.

So the library is seeded once, on first run, with flows that work with no
configuration at all: no coordinates to pick, no image to capture, nothing
to fill in. Press Play and something happens. The five that do the clicking
and typing are inside the free tier on purpose — this is the path to a first
success, and putting a paywall on it would defeat the point of having one.

⚠ The sixth, `PRO_EXAMPLE`, is the deliberate exception and it is not an
oversight. The paid half is otherwise only ever met by *refusal*, which
requires having already built a flow out of steps whose point you would have
to know in advance — so someone perfectly happy with the clicker never finds
out the rest of the product exists. That one is a readable example of it.
See `_pro_example`.

⚠ It currently runs, like everything else, because `entitlements.ENFORCED` is
False. Its frame is written to be true either way: it says which half those
steps belong to and never what they cost.

Anything counting "automations that arrive needing nothing filled in" counts
`free_starters()`, never `STARTERS` — the landing page says five because the
five clicking-and-typing ones are what that claim is about.

Each carries a Frame (the box drawn behind the graph) that says what it
does, how to stop it, and which node to double-click to change it. That is
the only documentation a first-time user reliably reads, because it is
already on the screen they are looking at.

⚠ Seeded exactly once, and never into a library that already has something
in it — see `seed`. Re-creating a starter somebody deleted would make them
undeletable, which is worse than never shipping them.

    Every other starter exists so a new user succeeds at something; this one

    else in the app tells them — the paid half is otherwise met only by being
    refused, and being refused requires having already built a flow out of
    steps whose point you would have to know in advance.

    So: a flow that watches the screen and reacts to what it sees, sitting in
    the library, readable, editable, in plain language.

    ⚠ Today it also *runs*, because `entitlements.ENFORCED` is False. When
    that changes, pressing Play on it opens the upgrade dialog naming exactly
    the steps it uses — which is the designed path rather than an ambush. Its
    frame is therefore written to say which half these steps belong to and
    never what they cost, so it stays true across the switch. Do not put a
    price or the word "needs" back into it.

    ⚠ It watches and never touches. A Detect step with `click` off sends no
    input at all, so someone pressing Play on the example straight away gets
    a flow that reads the screen and stops, not one that clicks somewhere
    nobody asked for. That is also what makes it a clean demonstration: the
    free half is all the input and the paid half is all the watching, and
    this isolates the one being shown.
