Two things that never worked, a library that is no longer empty, and the
groundwork for a paid tier that is not switched on.

**Every feature is still free.** Macronaut now contains the machinery for a Pro
tier — you will see a "Your licence" card in Settings — and none of it is
switched on. Nothing you can do today stops working, nothing is watermarked,
nothing expires, and you do not need a key.

Pro will be €9.99 once, later, covering the steps that watch the screen and
decide what to do. It stays off until enough people are using Macronaut for
that to be worth doing. When it changes it will be said plainly and in
advance, and anything you have already built will keep working.

**"Select region on screen…" works.** In Settings, under *Keep clicks inside a
region*, it did nothing at all — the overlay was collected by Python the
instant it opened, so the window died before you could drag in it. The same
control reached from a Detect step was always fine, which is why this went
unnoticed for so long.

**Auto-Click can be added to a flow.** The node type was real, saved flows
contained it, the engine ran it and its editor worked — there was simply no
button that created one. Two Settings cards, click region and pause-on-focus,
read their values from an Auto-Click node and were therefore inert for every
flow anybody could actually build.

**The Script Library arrives with six automations in it.** A new install used
to open on an empty canvas and an empty library. Now there is an auto-clicker,
one that stops after 100 clicks, one that clicks every 30 seconds to keep a
session awake, one that types a block of text, one that presses a key 50 times,
and an example that watches the screen for a word. None need setting up: open
one and press Play. Each carries a note on the canvas saying what it does, how
to stop it, and which node to change.

If you already have scripts saved, nothing was added to your library — that
would be five files you did not make appearing next to work you did. Press
**Add examples** in the Library when you want them. It never overwrites
anything you already have under the same name, and it is also how you get one
back after deleting it.

**Macronaut no longer opens on top of everything.** Always-on-top defaulted to
on, so a first launch parked the window over whatever you were doing before
asking. It helps while a flow runs and is purely in the way while one is being
built. Still in Settings → Appearance.

**The window title says the version it actually is.** It had read "2.0" since
2.0, which is unhelpful in a screenshot attached to a bug report.
