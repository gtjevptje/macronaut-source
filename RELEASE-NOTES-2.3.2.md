# Macronaut 2.3.2 — Basic, remastered, and a purple that reaches the edges

2.3.0 brought the Basic auto-clicker back and 2.3.1 made a new install actually
open on it. This release is about how it *looks* — because what came back was
the 2.0 window, and it wore the wrong colours in a wrong-looking way.

## Basic has been rebuilt

Three labelled cards — **Click interval**, **Click**, **Options** — instead of a
column of grey boxes. Aligned labels, real spacing, buttons that look like the
buttons everywhere else in the app, and a Start bar you can find without
reading. Everything it did before, it still does; nothing moved anywhere
surprising.

## Cosmic is a real theme now, and it is the default

Macronaut has shipped a purple rocket, a purple website and a navy-blue
application since 2.0. The purple was never a theme — it was four hardcoded
copies of a colour, in four places, while the actual default theme was
**Mission Control**, a navy console.

**Cosmic** is now a proper theme sitting alongside Mission Control, Graphite and
Daylight in **Settings → Appearance**, and it is what Macronaut opens on.

**If you never picked a theme, you will see this one on your next launch.** That
is deliberate: the app now looks like the thing it is named after. If you *did*
choose a theme on purpose, you keep it — picking Mission Control is a decision,
and an update should not overrule it. You can switch back in two clicks either
way.

## The title bar follows the theme too

The window's title bar, the canvas header and the settings drawer each painted
themselves and ignored the theme entirely. On **Daylight** that meant a dark
purple bar sitting on top of a light window; between Basic and Advanced it meant
two slightly different shades of the same bar. All three now take their colour
from the theme, so every theme is the whole window.

## Auto-Click has left the palette

The **⚡ Auto-Click** button is gone from the node palette on the canvas. Basic
*is* the auto-clicker now, and having a second one hiding in a palette was one
place too many.

Nothing was removed from the app. Every saved flow that contains an Auto-Click
step still runs exactly as before, still opens its own editor when you
double-click it, and is still free — including repeat counts and intervals,
which a Click inside a Loop is not.

---

Everything in 2.3.0 and 2.3.1 is unchanged. The whole Basic face is free
permanently, and every Pro feature is still free for now, with nothing to enter
and nothing to buy. Pro will be **€9.99 once**, later.

Existing installs update themselves on restart. New downloads: Windows will say
*"Windows protected your PC"* because the file is not code-signed yet — click
**More info**, then **Run anyway**.
