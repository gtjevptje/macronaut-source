"""
The key blacklist — the safety net that was not held by anything.

Settings ▸ Key blacklist says, in the app's own words: "any key listed here
will never be sent by scripts or keystroke automation (e.g. block Win or
Alt+F4)". It is what stops a script from opening the Start menu or closing the
window it is working in, and it is the sort of thing somebody switches on
precisely because a script has already misbehaved once.

⚠ It survived a mutation. `scratchpad/mutation_audit.py` replaced

    def _blocked(self, key_str): return key_str.lower() in self._blockset

with `return False` — every blocked key sent, the whole feature off — and the
entire suite stayed green (8 September 2026). CLAUDE.md recorded "17 mutations,
all caught"; this one is not in that set.

Both paths matter and they are different code: a key/combo step checks each key
before pressing any of them, and a text step filters blocked characters out of
the string.
