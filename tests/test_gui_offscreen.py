"""Window behaviour that can be checked without a human watching.

TESTING.md section D is the manual GUI pass, on the grounds that no automated
check here can see a window. That is true of *appearance* — flicker, whether the
compact face looks right at 150% scaling, always-on-top over a borderless game.
It is not true of everything section D lists. Qt's `offscreen` platform builds
real widgets with real geometry and real window flags, and the multi-monitor
cases can be simulated by handing the code a fake screen.

What that buys, specifically:

  * whether MainWindow constructs at all under PySide6 — the Qt binding changed,
    and nothing else in this suite ever builds the main window;
  * whether the overlays span the whole virtual desktop, which is the bug this
    file was written for and which no single-monitor test could ever see;
  * whether repeated compact <-> Advanced switching keeps its flags.

Still needs eyes, and deliberately not attempted here: flag *flicker* during the
toggle, real DPI scaling, always-on-top over a fullscreen game, and whether any
of it looks right.
