"""Unsaved-work recovery, and reopening where you left off.

⚠ **The bug these exist for.** Until 4 September 2026, closing Macronaut threw
away whatever was on the canvas — no prompt, no autosave, no restore. Half an
hour of work, gone, on the *normal* path out of the app.

The half of this file that matters most is not `recovery.py`'s functions, which
are small and easy. It is the **wiring**: that `_save_state` really calls the
writer on the way out, that the timer really runs, that Save really retires the
copy, and that answering the dialog really deletes it. A safety net whose
mechanism is perfect and whose caller was never hooked up is exactly the shape
of the original bug, and it would test green all day.
