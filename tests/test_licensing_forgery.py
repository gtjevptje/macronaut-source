"""Nothing that was not signed may unlock Pro.

⚠ Deliberately separate from `test_licensing.py`, which needs
`tools/mint_license.py` to mint the real keys it then tries to break — and
that tool is not in the public repository, so the whole module skips on a
clean clone. Nothing here mints anything. It only forges, so it runs
everywhere, including exactly the checkout where somebody is reading the
verifier and wondering how solid it is.

The failure mode is asymmetric, as that file says: a wrongly *rejected* key
produces a complaint within the hour, and a wrongly *accepted* one produces
silence and no revenue. So this asks the question from the attacker's side: keys that are correct in
every way except the signature, built with the module's own `encode_payload`
and `format_key` — which needs no private key, and is exactly the position an
attacker is in. None of them may parse, raise, or move `is_pro()`.
