"""
Search-area support in matcher.

The one thing a region must never do is move the answer. A match found inside a
crop is reported at crop-relative coordinates, and every caller — the click on
a found image, the box the Test-match preview draws — reads the result as
full-screenshot pixels. Getting the shift wrong doesn't fail loudly; it clicks
somewhere else on the screen.
