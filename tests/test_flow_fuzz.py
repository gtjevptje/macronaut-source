"""Adversarial graphs through the interpreter.

Flows are plain JSON on purpose and the README invites you to open one, so the
interpreter's real input is not "whatever the canvas produced" — it is
anything. These build graphs the canvas would never make: labels named `None`,
a loop counting to `"seven"`, an op called `"??"`, ports that do not belong on
the node they leave, Go tos pointing at nothing, and cycles.

`run()` already catches broadly, so "does it raise" is not the question. These
are the questions:

  * does it always terminate, and quickly?
  * is the status always one of the documented ones?
  * do the variables survive as a dict?

⚠ Deterministic by seed, so a failure is reproducible. `scratchpad/
fuzz_interpreter.py` is the same generator with the iteration count turned up —
8,000 graphs found nothing on 4 September 2026, which is what earned this a
place in the suite rather than a place in the bin.

⚠ Two ways this was silently vacuous before it worked, both worth remembering
because neither failed:

  * the edge helper is `add_edge`, not `connect`, and the call sat inside a
    bare `except Exception: pass` — so no graph had any wires, every run was
    one step long, and it reported "3000 graphs, 0 problems". The tell was the
    clock: 0.1 s for 3,000 graphs.
  * ports were then chosen uniformly at random, so a Start node's `out` port
    was wired 1 time in 7 and the median run was still 1 step. A fuzzer that
    does not reach the code cannot find anything in it.

Coverage is asserted below for exactly that reason.
