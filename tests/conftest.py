# ── The suite must not edit the developer's own installation ─────────────────
#
# ⚠ Same class of bug as the injection one below, and it had the same shape:
# a real side effect on the machine running the tests, believed to be covered
# and not. Tests build a real `SettingsManager` and a real `MainWindow`, both
# of which read *and write* `~/.macronaut/settings.json`. Running the suite
# therefore rewrote the developer's live settings — and it did it on every
# file save, because the PostToolUse hook runs pytest.
#
# It was found the hard way: `starters.seed_once` records a flag, the suite
# ran, and the developer's own copy silently became one that had "already been
# offered the starter flows" and never would be again.
#
# Three references have to be redirected and only the first is obvious:
#
#   1. `data_dir` / `scripts_dir`, the functions.
#   2. `SETTINGS_DIR` / `SETTINGS_FILE`, which are module *constants* resolved
#      at import time — so patching the functions above does nothing for them,
#      which is exactly the trap that made several sandboxed-looking scripts
#      in scratchpad/ read the real file anyway.
#   3. `main.py` does `from settings import data_dir, scripts_dir`, so it holds
#      its own names and a later patch of the `settings` module would never
#      reach them.
#
# Which is why this runs at conftest *import* time and not in a fixture, and
# why no separate patch of `main` is needed: pytest imports this file before
# any test module, so by the time anything imports `main` these two names are
# already the sandboxed ones and `main` copies those. Patching in a fixture
# would be both too late and, for the same reason, permanently wrong.

    ⚠ This is a bug that hung the whole suite, not tidiness. Every MainWindow

    out. The suite builds many windows and runs for ~40 seconds, so those shots
    mature and then fire inside whichever *unrelated* test next pumps events. If
    a crash report happens to be queued at that moment -- and the consent tests
    queue one -- `_run` opens a **modal** `ConsentDialog`, whose `exec()` blocks
    forever because no one is there to answer it.

    It presents as `test_the_consent_text_is_not_clipped` hanging, which is
    misleading: that test is a bystander that merely happened to call
    `processEvents()` at the wrong moment. Whether it hangs at all depends on
    how the 8 seconds line up against test order and machine speed, so it comes
    and goes and looks like flakiness.

    Delaying rather than stubbing `schedule` keeps the real function under test:

    PostToolUse hook runs this suite on every file save, so it was twenty
    requests per edit, from a machine that never asked to check for updates.

    `MainWindow.__init__` arms `QTimer.singleShot(4000, self._maybe_check_updates)`.
    The suite builds many windows and runs far longer than four seconds, so

    events — the same shape as the crash-consent timer above, and as
    `_offer_recovery` in test_gui_offscreen.py. Here the payload is a network
    call rather than a modal, so it does not hang; it just quietly goes out.

    ⚠ Blocked at `urllib.request.urlopen` — the actual door — and not at any
    of the three tempting places above it. That took two wrong tries worth
    recording, because each looked like "the boundary" until the tests said
    otherwise:

      * `_maybe_check_updates` is one caller. A guard there stops covering the
        moment a second caller appears.
      * `fetch_manifest` has its own web-host-to-API fallback, and two tests
        exercise it; stubbing it made them assert against this guard's message
        instead of the one they were written for.
      * `updater._get` has the retry/backoff logic, and three more tests
        exercise *that* by stubbing urlopen underneath it.

    Every one of those layers is somebody's subject. `urlopen` is the only
    thing that is nobody's subject and everybody's dependency. Tests that want
    a specific network behaviour patch it themselves and their stub wins for
    the duration, which is exactly right.
