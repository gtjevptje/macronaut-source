"""Licence keys: what a Pro key is, and whether this copy has a valid one.

Macronaut is free to download and free to use as an auto-clicker. The Pro tier
unlocks the parts that turn it into automation — seeing the screen, branching on
what it sees, and flows longer than a handful of steps. `entitlements.py` owns
*which* features those are; this module owns only the question "is this copy
licensed?", so the policy can be argued about without anyone touching crypto.

## The shape of the scheme, and why

**Offline, signed, perpetual.** A key is a small blob of facts — tier, buyer's
e-mail, order id, issue date — with an Ed25519 signature over them. Macronaut
carries the *public* key and can only check; keys are minted by
`tools/mint_license.py`, which holds the private half and never ships.

Each of those words was a decision:

- **Offline** because a licence server is a monthly bill, a privacy question and
  a thing that can be down at the exact moment a paying customer is trying to
  work. It also means no telemetry: Macronaut never learns that you activated,
  never mind when or how often.
- **Signed, not hashed.** The tempting cheap version is an HMAC of the e-mail
  with a secret baked into the app — a 20-character key instead of this long
  one. It is worthless: the secret has to ship in order to be checked, so the
  first person to open the .exe in a hex editor can mint unlimited keys. With
  Ed25519 the app holds nothing worth stealing.
- **Perpetual, with no expiry field at all.** Not just a pricing preference —
  it removes the clock from the trust model. A licence that expires must be
  checked against a date, the date comes from the user's own machine, and a
  wrong clock (or a deliberately wrong one) then either locks out someone who
  paid or extends someone who didn't. Neither is a problem worth inventing.
- **The buyer's e-mail is inside the key and shown in the UI.** It is not
  verified against anything and is not meant to be: it is there so that posting
  your key on a forum posts your e-mail address with it. That is the whole
  anti-sharing mechanism, and it is deliberately social rather than technical,
  because every technical one (machine fingerprints, activation counts) mostly
  succeeds at punishing the honest customer who bought a new laptop.

## What this scheme does not do

It does not stop a determined person from patching the check out of the .exe.
Nothing that runs on the customer's computer can. The goal is that *paying is
easier than not paying* for the ordinary person, which this achieves, while the
one thing that would actually cost money — a key generator anyone can run —
stays impossible without the private key.

## Key format

    MN1-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-…

`MN1` is the format generation (bump it only for a genuinely incompatible
payload; a new *field* does not need one, see `decode_payload`). The rest is
RFC 4648 base32 of `payload ‖ signature`, unpadded, in groups of eight.

Base32 rather than base64 because a licence key gets read aloud, retyped off a
phone screen and pasted out of an e-mail that helpfully capitalised it: base32's
alphabet has no case to lose and omits 0/1/8/9, so there is no 0-vs-O or 1-vs-l
to get wrong. The cost is length — a 64-byte signature is 104 characters before
anything else — so the UI is built around pasting, and `parse_key` accepts the
key with any spacing, casing or line breaks it arrives in.
