"""Selectable input-send backends: pynput (default), SendInput scancodes,
Interception driver — for both the keyboard and the mouse.

Macronaut's engines (clicker.py, flow_exec.py, recorder.py) send keys through a
pynput `keyboard.Controller` (`self._kb`) and clicks through a pynput
`mouse.Controller` (`self._mouse`). Games differ in what injected input they
accept:

- "pynput"       — virtual-key codes via the message queue. Fine for normal apps,
                   ignored by many games.
- "sendinput"    — SendInput with hardware scancodes (sendinput_backend.py).
                   Works for games on raw input / DirectInput.
- "interception" — kernel-driver injection (interception_backend.py). For games
                   that reject all user-mode input (e.g. Ghost of Tsushima).
                   Needs the Interception driver installed + a one-time
                   `python interception_backend.py --identify`.

`make_keyboard()` / `make_mouse()` return objects with the pynput Controller
surface the engines already use — `press` / `release` / `type` taking pynput
Key/KeyCode objects, and `position` / `press` / `release` / `click` taking pynput
Button objects — so swapping backends is a one-line change at the construction
site. One setting, `input_backend`, drives both.

Fallback policy: if the chosen backend is unavailable (driver not installed,
import failure), you get pynput plus a human-readable warning string — callers
surface it in the run log.

Text typing (`type`) goes out as real key presses on *every* backend, pynput
included. It used to be KEYEVENTF_UNICODE, on the reasoning that scancodes fight
the keyboard layout — but VK_PACKET carries a codepoint rather than a key
position, so it only ever produces WM_CHAR, and a game reading raw input or
DirectInput never sees it. That is why a flow could press a key and press Enter
successfully and type nothing in between.

⚠ pynput's own `type()` is a *mixture*, and that mixture is what made the bug so
hard to name: it resolves each character with VkKeyScan and sends a real key when
no modifier is needed, but a bare Unicode packet when one is — never pressing the
modifier. On a Belgian layout that splits a sentence in half. Lowercase letters
and space arrive; capitals, digits and "." do not. It reads as "only capitals are
broken" when the real fault line is "characters that need a modifier".

`key_positions` decides which keyboard the target is assumed to be reading (see
settings.type_key_positions).

Reading the cursor position always resolves to the real OS cursor — every
backend is a write-only path.

    ⚠ **A game does not read characters.** `KEYEVENTF_UNICODE` delivers a
    codepoint with no key behind it, which produces `WM_CHAR` and nothing else,
    so a target reading raw input or DirectInput never sees it. Real key events
    reach both kinds of receiver, which is why typing has to travel the same
    road press()/release() already take.

    This is also, exactly, why the original bug looked like a capitals bug.
    pynput's own `type()` resolves each character with `VkKeyScan` and sends a
    **real key** when the character needs no modifier — but falls back to a
    Unicode packet when it does, *without pressing the modifier*. On a Belgian
    layout that splits a sentence in two: lowercase letters, space and `!` are
    real keys and arrive; capitals, digits and `.` are Unicode and vanish. The
    reported "everything types except capitals" was that split, not a case bug.

    Three releases were then spent moving *more* of the text onto the Unicode
    path — batched (2.0.14), paced (2.0.15), unmodified (2.0.16) — each one
    strictly further from a receiver that was never reading characters at all,
    ending at "it doesn't type anything". The direction was backwards the whole
    time.

    Only `type` changes; press/release are pynput's, unchanged.

    A packet carries the **character**; a scancode carries a **key position**
    and lets the receiver decide which character that is. Both are right, for
    different targets, and the backend selector is already the choice between
    them: pynput *is* the message-queue backend, and `sendinput` / `interception`
    exist precisely for targets that ignore the message queue.

    ⚠ 2.0.17 moved this class's job onto the scancode path, which put
    driver-backend behaviour inside the message-queue backend. It fixed a real
    bug — pynput's own `type()` sends a modifier-needing character as a bare
    packet *without pressing the modifier*, so on a Belgian layout capitals,
    digits and `.` never arrived — but it did so by taking away the one property
    that made this backend worth choosing. On an AZERTY board a scancode target
    reads `a` as `q`, and every digit becomes a shifted keystroke costing a
    modifier settle. That is a regression for everyone typing into an ordinary
    window, which is who selects pynput.

    So the modifier bug is fixed here the other way: `sendinput_backend.type_text`
    sends every character as a packet, never pynput's mixture, so nothing depends
    on a modifier being pressed. A target that reads raw input still sees none of
    it — that target is what the other two backends are for.
